# jsonDF
Metadata management and conversions Between R Data Frames, JSON Schemas, JSON data files, and markdown/HTML/SQL code

## Summary 

Metadata management is getting increasingly important also for data analysts, statisticians, and bioinformaticians. 
Documenting of data frames and variables as well as validation of data frame's records are crucial for efficient handling of metadata in your analysis pipelines. 

The `jsonDF` package facilitates generation of documentation of variables in R data frames, their validation via [JSON Schemas](https://json-schema.org/), and conversion between data frames and JSON data files. 
Tools for rendering variable documentation as markdown and HTML files accessible to your collaborators and customers are provided as well. 

## Remarks

The `data.frame` - `JSON` - `JSON Schema`, `data.frame` - `documentation` - `documentation Markdowm/HTML` conversion tools are more or less ready. 
Working on SQL code generators given variable documentation of a JSON Schema.
